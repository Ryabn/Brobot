# Quadruped

A Four Legged robot in the making from scratch.
<br>Find video of working leg in images file
<br>Currently uses:
<ul>
  <li>3 Servos (MG995's & MG996's)
  <li>Arduino Uno (will try to switch to nano)
  <li>Adafruits 16-channel PWM driver
  <li>5V 12A AC/DC adapter
  <li>Wooden Box
</ul>

I've spent about 20USD and around 5 hours and have one programmed leg down. I'm currently waiting for my other parts (servos, servo arm/brackets) to come in so I can finish the other 3 legs. After that, I'm planning on maybe adding 2 other legs as 6 legs would allow me to program more fluid movements as well as a more responsive body. It's currently programmed to only work on flat surfaces (I used flat values for movement rather than variables), I plan on adding pressure sensors to the legs to ensure stability on the system when it crawls over uneven surfaces.
