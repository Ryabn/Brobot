I wanted to make a robot... so I made one.

Future Goals(because it's not done!):
-add sensors to allow for uneven surface walking
-develop a "mind" for it so it can be voice activated, as well as intelligent

I switched out the body using clear acrylic boxes as they were easier to work with, see through, and so much more sexier.
